# GitHub Copilot lab for Leads & Architects
A hands-on lab to introduce leads & architects to working with GitHub Copilot to understand code, generate documentation in Markdown format, generate diagrams using Mermaid and using Copilot for code reviews. You do not need to have any prior experience with Mermaid or Markdown to complete this lab!

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> My aim is to cover the below content - this is currently a WIP - happy for anyone to contribute:
> Copilot Business:
> - Explain this solution / codebase
> - Ask for suggestions / improvements around insecure coding practices
> - Document methods / classes
> - Generate a README.md file that gives new developers guidance on how to get up and going with the solution
> - Generate diagrams using mermaid
> 	- ERD
>  	- Sequence Diagram
> 	- Azure Solution Architecture
> 	
> Copilot Enterprise:
> - Query a repo
> - PR descriptions
> - PR Review with Copilot
> - Building a knowledge base

**Proposed duration:** 60-120 minutes (excluding prerequisites setup).

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) installed and licensed
- [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) extension for Visual Studio Code

## Pre Lab Setup
Setting Up GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code:
1. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
    - If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install GitHub Copilot:**
    - Open Visual Studio Code.
    - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Cmd+Shift+X`.
    - Search for "GitHub Copilot" and click the "Install" button.
3. **Sign In to GitHub Copilot:**
    - After installation, you will be prompted to sign in to GitHub Copilot.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate with your GitHub account.
4. **Verify Installation:**
    - Open a new file in Visual Studio Code.
    - Start typing a comment or a piece of code, and you should see suggestions from GitHub Copilot.
    - If you see suggestions, GitHub Copilot is successfully installed and ready to use.
5. **Basic Usage:**
    - Create a new JavaScript file (`example.js`).
    - Start typing a function definition, e.g. `function add(a, b) {`.
    - Observe how GitHub Copilot suggests the implementation of the function.
    - Accept the suggestion by pressing `Tab`.
6. **Exploring Different Features:**
    - **Code Completions:**
        - Start typing a comment or code, and GitHub Copilot will provide inline suggestions.
        - Accept suggestions by pressing `Tab`.
    - **Chat:**
        - Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`).
        - Type "GitHub Copilot: Chat" and select it.
        - Use the chat interface to ask questions or request code snippets.
    - **Inline Chat:**
        - Highlight a piece of code.
        - Right-click and select "Ask GitHub Copilot".
        - Use the inline chat to get explanations or improvements for the selected code.

By the end of this step, you should have GitHub Copilot installed and be familiar with its basic functionality, including code completions, chat, and inline chat in Visual Studio Code.
